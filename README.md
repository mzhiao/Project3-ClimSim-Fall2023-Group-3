+ **Project summary and goals:** In this project, we sought to help the ClimSim project by addressing the following questions through our exploration:
	+ Is the ClimSim GitHub repo with its associated "quick start" guide and demo notebooks set up in a way to provide data scientists an easy entryway to play with the data set and contribute ideas?
	+ Could one use collaborative cloud-based notebooks such as Google Colab or Huggingface Spaces to explore the dataset's numerous files on Huggingface?
	+ What data selection, visualizations and/or processing workflows could be created so that one could apply various ML/DL models on some aspects of the ClimSim data? This is especially interesting given the dataset is already on Huggingface, which hosts a large number of models for NLP and computer vision.
	+ What advanced ML/DL models could be applied to the ClimSim data set to improve the evaluation metrics?

+ **Findings:**
	+ We used a Zero-Inflated Poisson Model.
 	+ We chose this model because our data distirbution had an excess number of zeroes.
